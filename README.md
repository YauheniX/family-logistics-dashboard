2. **Personal Wishlists** — Create wish lists that can be publicly shared via a unique link. Anyone (no login required) can view and reserve items.
3. **Family Groups** — Create a family, invite members by email, and collaborate on shared shopping lists.
4. **Role-Based Access** — Family owners can manage members; all members can create and edit shopping lists.
5. **Public Wishlist Sharing** — Share wishlists via `/w/:share_slug` — visitors can reserve items without logging in.
