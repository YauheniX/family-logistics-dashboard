## 🎯 What Is This?

A **multi-tenant household management system** built for families and shared households. Each **household** is a fully isolated tenant — members within a household collaborate on shopping lists and wishlists.

**Core capabilities**:

1. **Shared Shopping Lists** — Create and manage shopping lists within your household. Members can add items, mark purchases, and see who bought what.
2. **Personal Wishlists** — Create wishlists that can be publicly shared via a unique link. Anyone (no login required) can view and reserve items.
3. **Household Management** — Create a household, invite members by email, and manage roles.
4. **Role-Based Access** — Five-tier role hierarchy (Owner → Admin → Member → Child → Viewer).
5. **Public Wishlist Sharing** — Share wishlists via `/w/:share_slug` — visitors can reserve items without logging in.
6. **Mock Mode** — Runs entirely in the browser with no backend. Perfect for demos and local development.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🏠 **Household Groups** — Create households, invite members, manage roles
- 🛒 **Shared Shopping Lists** — Add items, mark purchased, see who bought what, archive lists
- 🎁 **Personal Wishlists** — Create wishlists with priority, price, links, and images
- 🌐 **Public Wishlist Sharing** — Share via unique link; visitors can reserve items without login
- 🔐 **Secure Auth** — Google OAuth + email/password (Supabase mode)
- 📊 **Dashboard** — Stats for active lists, items to buy, reserved wishlist items
- 🧪 **Mock Mode** — Full frontend functionality without a backend (localStorage)
- ✅ **Production-Ready** — Clean architecture, comprehensive tests, CI/CD pipeline

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application follows **Clean Architecture** with a feature-based module structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Presentation["Presentation Layer"]
        A[Vue 3 Components]
        B[Pinia Stores]
        C[Composables]
    end

    subgraph Domain["Domain Layer"]
        D[Entities]
        E[DTOs]
        F[Service Interfaces]
    end

    subgraph Infrastructure["Infrastructure Layer"]
        G[Supabase Repositories]
        H[Mock Repositories]
    end

    Presentation --> Domain
    Domain --> Infrastructure
```

**Multi-Tenant Model**: Every piece of data (shopping lists, wishlists, members) belongs to a **household**. Row-Level Security (RLS) enforces tenant isolation at the database level — users can only access data belonging to their household.

```mermaid
graph TD
    HH["🏠 Household (tenant)"]
    HH --> M["👥 Members (with roles)"]
    HH --> SL["🛒 Shopping Lists"]
    SL --> SI["📝 Shopping Items"]
    M -.-> WL["🎁 Wishlists (personal)"]
    WL --> WI["📋 Wishlist Items"]
```

See [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) for full details.

## 🔧 Full Setup with Supabase

For real multi-user authentication and cloud sync:

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → **New project**
2. Note your **Project URL** and **anon/public key** from Project Settings → API

### 2. Apply Database Schema

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
npx supabase db push

# Or manually run the schema file
# Paste contents of supabase/schema.sql in the Supabase SQL editor
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key-here
VITE_USE_MOCK_BACKEND=false
```

### 4. Configure Google OAuth (Optional)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → OAuth credentials
2. Add `http://localhost:5173` as an authorized redirect URI
3. Add your credentials to Supabase: **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Google**

### 5. Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

See [Installation Guide](docs/getting-started/installation.md) and [Supabase Setup](docs/backend/supabase-setup.md) for full details.

## 🔐 Roles & Permissions

The system uses a **five-tier role hierarchy**:

| Role       | Description                         | Can Invite | Can Edit Content | Admin Access |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| **Owner**  | Full control, created the household | ✅         | ✅               | ✅           |
| **Admin**  | Co-manager, can manage members      | ✅         | ✅               | ✅           |
| **Member** | Standard household member           | ❌         | ✅               | ❌           |
| **Child**  | Limited access, no invitations      | ❌         | Partial          | ❌           |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access                    | ❌         | ❌               | ❌           |

**Public Guest** (unauthenticated) can only access public wishlists via share link.

See [RBAC Permission Matrix](docs/architecture/rbac-permissions.md) for the full permission table.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

**Coverage requirement**: 70% minimum (lines, branches, functions, statements).

Tests are located in `__tests__/` directories co-located with the source files:

```bash
src/features/shopping/__tests__/
src/features/wishlist/__tests__/
src/stores/__tests__/
```

See [Testing Guide](docs/testing/overview.md) for the full testing strategy.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

Two GitHub Actions workflows run on every push and pull request to `main`:

| Workflow   | Trigger           | Steps                           |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **CI**     | push/PR to `main` | Lint → Test → Coverage check    |
| **CodeQL** | push/PR to `main` | Security vulnerability scanning |

**CI fails if**:

- ESLint reports errors
- Any test fails
- Code coverage drops below 70%

See [CI/CD Documentation](docs/operations/ci-cd.md) for full pipeline details.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### App shows blank screen

Check the browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors. Common cause: missing or invalid environment variables.

### Mock mode not activating

Verify `VITE_USE_MOCK_BACKEND=true` in your `.env.local`, or ensure Supabase credentials are absent (mock mode activates automatically without credentials).

### Port 5173 already in use

```bash
# Kill the process using the port
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
# Or use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### `npm install` fails

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Supabase connection errors

1. Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct
2. Check that RLS policies are applied (`supabase/schema.sql`)
3. Ensure the database schema migrations have been run

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/operations/troubleshooting.md) for more solutions.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use this without Supabase?**  
A: Yes — Mock Mode uses browser localStorage. No backend required. Run `npm run dev` to start immediately.

**Q: How do I invite someone to my household?**  
A: Navigate to **Household** → **Members** → **Invite Member**. Enter their email address. They will see the invitation when they log in.

**Q: Can wishlists be shared with people who don't have an account?**  
A: Yes. Toggle a wishlist to **Public**, then share the generated `/w/:share_slug` link. Anyone with the link can view and reserve items.

**Q: What does "Child" role mean?**  
A: Children can add shopping items and create wishlists, but cannot invite members or manage lists. They can have an account or exist as a "soft member" (no account).

**Q: How is data isolated between households?**  
A: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) enforces household isolation at the database level. See [Multi-Tenant Architecture](docs/architecture/multi-tenant.md).

See [FAQ](docs/operations/faq.md) for more answers.
