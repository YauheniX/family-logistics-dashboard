## 1. What Is This App?

The **Family Shopping & Wishlist Planner** is a collaborative household management tool that helps families and shared households:

- **Plan shopping together** — shared lists where everyone can add items, mark purchases, and see progress in real time.
- **Manage wishlists** — personal wish lists for birthdays, holidays, or everyday needs. Share them publicly so others can reserve gifts without logging in.
- **Coordinate as a group** — invite household members, assign roles, and control who can do what.

### Who Is This For?

| User Type | Use Case |
| --------- | -------- |
| **Household owner** | Sets up the household, invites family members, manages roles |
| **Adult member** | Contributes to shopping lists, creates wishlists |
| **Child member** | Adds items to lists, maintains a personal wishlist |
| **Viewer** | Reads shopping lists and wishlists (e.g., grandparent, caregiver) |
| **Public guest** | Views and reserves items from a public wishlist (no account needed) |

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### Household

A **household** is the fundamental unit of the application. It is a private group — think of it as a "tenant". All shopping lists and household wishlists belong to a household.

- Every user must belong to at least one household to use the app.
- A user can be a member of multiple households.
- Households are completely isolated — members of one household cannot see data from another.

### Members

**Members** are people who belong to a household. Each member has a **role** that determines what they can do.

- Members with accounts (email/password or Google login) can manage their own data.
- **Soft members** (children or others without accounts) can be added by owners/admins without requiring an email or login. Their data is managed on their behalf.

### Shopping List

A **shopping list** is a shared list of items that household members collaboratively manage. Multiple shopping lists can exist per household (e.g., "Weekly Groceries", "Hardware Store", "Party Supplies").

### Wishlist

A **wishlist** is a personal list of desired items. Wishlists belong to individual users, not to the household as a whole. They can have three visibility states:

| Visibility | Who Can See |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Private** | Only the owner (and household owner/admin) |
| **Household** | All household members |
| **Public** | Anyone with the share link |

### Invitation

An **invitation** is how new members join a household. An owner or admin creates an invitation for an email address. When that person logs in with that email, they see the pending invitation and can accept or decline.

---

---

## 6. Shopping Lists

### What Is a Shopping List?

A shared list of items that household members can collaboratively build and check off. Shopping lists belong to the household — any member with the right permissions can add items or mark purchases.

### Creating a Shopping List

**Who can**: Owner, Admin, Member

1. Navigate to **Shopping Lists**.
2. Click **New List**.
3. Enter a title (e.g., "Weekly Groceries") and optional description.
4. Click **Create**.

### Adding Items

**Who can**: Owner, Admin, Member, Child

1. Open a shopping list.
2. Click **Add Item** or type in the item field.
3. Optionally set: quantity, category, notes.
4. Press **Enter** or click **Add**.

### Marking Items as Purchased

**Who can**: Owner, Admin, Member, Child

1. Click the checkbox next to an item.
2. The item is marked purchased and shows who bought it.
3. To undo, click the checkbox again.

### Purchase Tracking

When you mark an item as purchased, your name is recorded. This lets the household see:
- Which items still need to be bought
- Who completed each purchase

### Archiving a List

**Who can**: Owner, Admin, Member (own lists)

When a shopping trip is complete, archive the list:
1. Open the list.
2. Click **Archive**.

Archived lists are hidden from the active view but not deleted.

### Deleting a List

**Who can**: Owner, Admin (any list); Member (own lists)

1. Open the list.
2. Click **Delete**.
3. Confirm. **This is permanent.**

### Edge Cases

- An item can be marked purchased by any eligible member — not just the one who added it.
- Items cannot be deleted by the member who added them if another member added the item (only Owner/Admin can delete other members' items).
- Archiving does not delete items. Archived lists can be viewed under **Archived Lists**.

---

## 7. Wishlists

### What Is a Wishlist?

A personal list of desired items — gifts, things to buy for yourself, or household needs. Each wishlist belongs to an individual member, not the household.

### Creating a Wishlist

**Who can**: Owner, Admin, Member, Child

1. Navigate to **Wishlists**.
2. Click **New Wishlist**.
3. Enter a title (e.g., "Birthday Ideas") and optional description.
4. Select visibility: **Private**, **Household**, or **Public**.
5. Click **Create**.

### Adding Items to a Wishlist

1. Open a wishlist.
2. Click **Add Item**.
3. Enter item details:

| Field | Description | Required |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- |
| Title | Item name | ✅ |
| Description | Additional notes | No |
| URL | Link to the item (auto-previews title/image) | No |
| Price | Estimated price | No |
| Priority | High / Medium / Low | No |
| Image | Upload or URL | No |

### Visibility Settings

| Setting | Who Sees It |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Private** | Only you (and household Owner/Admin for oversight) |
| **Household** | All household members |
| **Public** | Anyone with the share link |

Change visibility at any time via wishlist settings.

### Reserving Items (Public View)

When someone views a public wishlist:
- They can mark items as **Reserved** (claiming they will buy it).
- This prevents gift duplication.
- The wishlist owner cannot see who reserved what (to preserve surprise).

### Edge Cases

- A user can have multiple wishlists.
- Owners and admins can view **all** wishlists, regardless of visibility (parental oversight).
- Children can create wishlists — ideal for birthday wish lists.
- Deleting a wishlist also deletes all its items. This is permanent.

---

## 8. Public Wishlist Sharing

### How It Works

1. Create a wishlist and set visibility to **Public**.
2. The system generates a unique share link: `https://yourapp.com/w/abc123xyz`
3. Share this link with anyone (via message, email, social media).
4. Recipients can view the list and reserve items **without creating an account**.

### Data Flow

```
Wishlist Owner
  └── Sets visibility to "Public"
        └── Share link generated (/w/:share_slug)
              └── Guest visits link
                    └── Guest reserves item
                          └── Item marked as "reserved" in database
                                └── Owner sees "1 item reserved" count
                                      (but not WHO reserved it)
```

### Privacy Notes

- The wishlist owner sees how many items are reserved, but **not by whom**.
- Reservations are anonymous.
- The share link can be regenerated, invalidating old links.

---

## 9. Invitations

### How Invitations Work

```
Admin/Owner creates invitation (email + role)
  └── Invitation stored with 7-day expiry
        └── Invitee logs in with that email
              └── Sees "You have a pending invitation" notification
                    └── Accepts or declines
                          └── If accepted: member record created
```

### Invitation States

| State | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Pending** | Sent, awaiting response |
| **Accepted** | Invitee joined the household |
| **Declined** | Invitee declined |
| **Expired** | Not responded to within 7 days |
| **Revoked** | Cancelled by owner/admin before acceptance |

### Notes

- Only one pending invitation per email per household at a time.
- Invitations do not send emails automatically — the admin must share the invitation details manually (via email, message, etc.).
- Expired invitations can be resent.

---

## 10. Dashboard

The **Dashboard** is the home screen after login. It shows:

| Widget | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Active Lists** | Count of active shopping lists in your household |
| **Items to Buy** | Count of unpurchased items across all active lists |
| **Wishlists** | Count of your wishlists |
| **Reserved Items** | Count of reserved items on your public wishlists |
| **Pending Invitations** | Invitations waiting for your response |

---

## 11. Account & Profile

### Updating Your Profile

1. Click your avatar/name in the top navigation.
2. Select **Profile** or **Settings**.
3. Update:
   - Display name
   - Avatar (upload an image)

### Changing Password

Managed through Supabase Auth. Use the **Forgot Password** flow on the login page.

### Signing Out

Click your avatar → **Sign Out**. All local session data is cleared.

---

## 12. Mock Mode

**Mock Mode** is a special mode where the app runs entirely in your browser with no backend server required.

### What Works in Mock Mode

✅ Full application functionality  
✅ Data persists in browser localStorage  
✅ No backend/network required  
✅ Perfect for demos and testing

### What Doesn't Work

⚠️ Data is browser-only (not shared between devices)  
⚠️ Data is lost if browser localStorage is cleared  
⚠️ No real authentication (demo user auto-created)  
⚠️ Single user only (no real collaboration)

### When Is Mock Mode Used?

- Automatically when no Supabase credentials are configured
- When `VITE_USE_MOCK_BACKEND=true` is set
- On GitHub Pages deployments (static hosting)

You will see an info banner at the top of the screen when Mock Mode is active.

---

## 13. Edge Cases & Limitations

### Household

- A user can belong to multiple households. Switch between them via the household selector.
- The Owner cannot leave without transferring ownership.
- Only one Owner per household.
- Deleting a household is permanent — all data is lost.

### Shopping Lists

- Items can only be marked purchased by authenticated members (not public guests).
- Archived lists are not shown in the main view but are still searchable.
- A list with items cannot be deleted if it contains purchased items — archive it instead.

### Wishlists

- Reservations on public wishlists are anonymous to the owner.
- Children can create wishlists even without their own account (managed via soft members).
- Public wishlists remain accessible after the owner leaves the household (by design — the share link continues to work).

### Invitations

- An invitation is tied to an email address, not a user account.
- If someone changes their email, the invitation for the old email will not match.
- Invitations expire after 7 days.

### Data Isolation

- RLS at the database level enforces that users cannot access another household's data, even with valid credentials.
- Public wishlist data is the only cross-household exception — anyone with the share link can read it.

## 14. Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
| ----- | ----- | -------- |
| "Not authorized" | Trying to perform an action your role doesn't allow | Check your role and required permissions |
| "Household not found" | Household was deleted or you were removed | Contact the household owner or create a new household |
| "Invitation expired" | Invitation is older than 7 days | Ask the owner/admin to resend the invitation |
| "Email already invited" | A pending invitation for this email exists | Wait for the existing invitation to expire or have the admin revoke it |
| "Network error" | Lost internet connection or Supabase is unreachable | Check internet connection, try again |

### What Happens if Supabase is Down?

- The app will show an error message.
- No data loss occurs — all data is in the database.
- Mock Mode is not affected (runs locally).
