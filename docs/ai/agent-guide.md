# 🤖 AI Agent Development Guide

> **This file has been consolidated into a single source of truth**

---

## 📍 Go Here Instead

**All AI agent instructions are now maintained in:**

👉 **[`/.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../../.github/copilot-instructions.md)**

---

## Why the Change?

Previously, we maintained three separate files:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (for GitHub Copilot)
- `AGENTS.md` (for Cursor/Cline)
- `docs/ai/agent-guide.md` (detailed guide)

**Problem**: Hard to keep three files in sync.

**Solution**: One file, one source of truth.
